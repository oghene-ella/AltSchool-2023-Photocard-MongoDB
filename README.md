## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Otavie/AltSchool-2023-Photocard-MongoDB.git

   cd AltSchool-2023-Photocard-MongoDB
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following environment variables:

   ```
   DB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
   PORT=port number
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `port number` with the actual port number you are using.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:<Port Number>` by default.

## Usage

1. After running `npm start`, open the site using your localhost link (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

2. Add your information/details by signing up as a student.

3. Log in using your email and password.

4. Edit or delete your profile as needed.

5. Log out when you're done.

6. Do your `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to raise your PR.

## Areas for Improvement/Limitations

- **Image Management**: Currently, image upload and editing functionality is not available. This limitation is due to the read-only nature of the filesystem in certain serverless environments, including AWS Lambda, which is commonly used by serverless platforms like Cyclic (where the project is hosted).

- **Search Functionality**: The application lacks search functionality to enable searching by specific criteria.

- **Pagination**: To improve user experience and performance, pagination functionality is needed to reduce the amount of profile cards displayed per page.
